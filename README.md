# Election_Prediction_Model

## Project Overview
This project was developed to predict voter support for different political parties using a comprehensive dataset from a survey conducted by CNBE. The model aims to forecast election outcomes and enhance the accuracy of exit poll predictions.

## Dataset
- **Source**: CNBE Survey
- **Sample Size**: 1525 voters
- **Variables**: 9 demographic and socio-economic factors

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- Model Selection: Various algorithms were evaluated, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
- Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curves.

## Conclusion
The model provides valuable insights into voter behavior and can be used to predict election outcomes with high accuracy.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by incorporating more advanced techniques.
- Explore the impact of additional demographic factors on voter preference.
